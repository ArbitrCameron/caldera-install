This is a bash script to install a copy of the Caldera server locally on Kali Linux. Prerequisites include updating APT and installing Node.JS. 

Run from a directory like home that doesn't need sudo privileges for the easiest time. 

Usage: ./Caldera-Install.sh

and that's it! 

(This is my very first public Bash script I've written, due to needing to use Caldera in my current role and setting it up from the Caldera's teams instructions are *very* unclear and lots of workarounds needed in order to make it work. After lots of headaches and troubleshooting, this sript looked to simplify this!)
